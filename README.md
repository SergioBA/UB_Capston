# UB_Capston
*Capston project repository for Data Science and Machine Learning Postgraduate Course.*

The goal of the project was to analyze Kvasir-Capsule dataset and test different DL models and technics (i.e. Data augmentation) to compare their classification rates.

UB_Capston project relies on Kvasir-Capsule dataset, which url can be accessed via: https://osf.io/gr7bn. Also, dataset can be downloaded via: https://osf.io/dv2ag/.

## Repository Structure
This repository has the following structure:
 * ðŸ“„ **[data](/data/)**: contains the dataset used. There you can find:
    * [OriginalDataset](/data/OriginalDataset/): dataset as provided from Kvasir-Capsule project (336 x 336)
    * dataSetOnly11Classes: original dataset but removing "Ampulla of vater", "Blood - hematin" and "Polyp" due to not enough samples to find patterns
    * dataSetPlits_0_1: original dataset splitted into two block for train & validation
 * ðŸ¤” **info**: contains reference information i.e. Kvasir-Capsule code, its thesis or DL links
 * ðŸ“– **docs**: contains UB_Capstone project documentation i.e. Analysis, methodology or models used
 * ðŸ›  **scripts**: folder to store all different tests developed during the project
    * experiments: contains the executed scripts
	* results: contains the scripts results
